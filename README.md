# 🚀 PatchedReShade v1.0

**PatchedReShade** is a modified version of ReShade designed to unlock the **depth buffer** in online games by disabling network traffic checks. This re-compilation allows you to enjoy enhanced post-processing effects like **depth of field**, **SSAO**, and **bloom** in multiplayer games, without the usual limitations.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔓 Depth Buffer Access**: Use ReShade’s depth-based effects in online multiplayer games without restrictions.
- **⚡ Bypassed Network Traffic Check**: This patch removes the network traffic check that blocks depth effects in online modes.
- **🎮 Enhanced Graphics**: Unlock advanced visual effects like SSAO, depth of field, and more, even while playing online.
- **🚀 Easy Setup**: Drop-in replacement for standard ReShade—no complex installation required.

## 🔧 How to Install

1. **Download** the **Patched ReShade Installer** from the [Releases](https://github.com/YourGitHub/PatchedReShade/releases) page.
2. **Run** the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to select the game you want to apply ReShade to.
3. **Choose** the rendering API used by your game (e.g., DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan) when prompted.
4. Complete the installation process as you would with a normal ReShade installation.
5. Launch your game, and you should now have full access to depth-based effects in multiplayer.

## 🛠️ Compatibility

This patch should work with most online multiplayer games, as long as they support ReShade. However, some anti-cheat systems may block ReShade entirely—check with your specific game’s policies.
